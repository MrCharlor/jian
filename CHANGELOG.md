## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-29

Conversations keep their context across runs, and new Work tasks start an executor automatically.

### Agent context

* **Continuous conversations:** new runs receive session messages since the last saved summary instead of a fixed set of 40 recent messages. Unanswered group messages remain part of that history. Relevant, sanitized tool inputs and results from earlier runs are also available as historical evidence, without repeating the calls.
* **Model-aware compaction:** Jian summarizes older conversation and tool context as the selected model's window fills, preserving the current request and recent work. Original messages remain stored. If context still cannot fit, the run reports the failure instead of silently dropping history.
* **Run limits:** the cumulative 500,000-token stop is removed. Each model call must still fit its model's context window; a 500-step backstop remains. Provider-reported usage continues to be recorded, and provider spending limits still apply.

### Work

* Creating a task now queues an executor subagent in the same transaction. Task guidance asks for enough context to act independently, including the objective, source references, current evidence, acceptance criteria, and next actions. The principal agent can continue orchestrating without duplicating the worker's execution.

### Upgrading

The gateway applies an additive session-summary cursor migration on startup. Existing messages and summaries are retained; no manual configuration is required.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-29

More reliable agent workflows, with optional Ponytail and Caveman support.

### Agent workflows

* **Work:** task workers can mark verified work done directly when an independent review is unnecessary. Work guidance now calls for task updates at meaningful checkpoints and before reporting completion, and recommends subagents for substantial independent tasks.
* **Jev:** action decisions can understand a recent, specific owner confirmation without treating older requests as blanket authorization. A held action remains a local decision instead of being misread as outside content. The daily token ceiling and its unused panel controls have been removed; individual Jev uses can still be switched off.
* **Tool results:** with Caveman mode on, large local command and file results preserve a useful beginning and outcome in their previews, with the complete result available as an artifact.

### Optional extensions

* **Ponytail:** built-in coding guidance can be switched off per agent, and its conversation mode can be changed with `/ponytail` commands.
* **Caveman:** built-in concise-response guidance is opt-in per conversation. The image includes a local Caveman proxy in record mode, disabled by default. Set `JIAN_CAVEMAN_ENABLED=true` to start it and route native OpenAI and Anthropic API-key calls through it. Subscription and other provider routes remain direct. The proxy address defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8788` and can be overridden for an externally managed listener.

### Upgrading

The gateway applies the new conversation-mode migrations on startup. No action is needed unless you want to enable the Caveman proxy; leave `JIAN_CAVEMAN_ENABLED` unset or `false` to keep direct provider calls.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-29

Agent-managed work boards and isolated task subagents arrive in Jian.

### Features

* **Work:** agents can track tasks across chats on a durable, per-agent board, with status, progress notes, history and optional images. The gateway panel lets the owner inspect the board and each task's activity, but only the agent can create or change tasks.
* **Task subagents:** a principal agent can spawn anonymous workers for a task with their own identity, brief and private transcript. Workers can execute or review work, and their results are handed back to the principal agent for orchestration.

### Improvements and fixes

* **Work panel:** the board scrolls within the page, and task details open in an overlay with the worker transcript and tool activity.
* **Overview:** waits for usage data before displaying the page, avoiding a layout shift. Codex subscription usage is shown as a weekly window; Claude retains its five-hour and weekly windows.
* **Branding:** browser, Safari and installed-app icons use the Jian mark.

### Upgrading

The gateway applies the new work and subagent database migrations on startup. No manual configuration is required.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-29
