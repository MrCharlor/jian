## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-29

Agent-managed work boards and isolated task subagents arrive in Jian.

### Features

* **Work:** agents can track tasks across chats on a durable, per-agent board, with status, progress notes, history and optional images. The gateway panel lets the owner inspect the board and each task's activity, but only the agent can create or change tasks.
* **Task subagents:** a principal agent can spawn anonymous workers for a task with their own identity, brief and private transcript. Workers can execute or review work, and their results are handed back to the principal agent for orchestration.

### Improvements and fixes

* **Work panel:** the board scrolls within the page, and task details open in an overlay with the worker transcript and tool activity.
* **Overview:** waits for usage data before displaying the page, avoiding a layout shift. Codex subscription usage is shown as a weekly window; Claude retains its five-hour and weekly windows.
* **Branding:** browser, Safari and installed-app icons use the Jian mark.

### Upgrading

The gateway applies the new work and subagent database migrations on startup. No manual configuration is required.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-29
